## STHC (simple texture hud config)
> STHC intends to be a pretty simple set of 2 parts where the reciever-part goes to the linked prim-set (clothes/furniture/etc) and the sender-part goes to any prim which is designed to be a HUD.


## Telly Pole
> This is designed to be a simple teleporter script where you can add SL-Landmarks to any prim (preferibly root if a linked set of prims) which will become teleport targets if anyone sits on the prim.


## To-Do
- [ ] fine-tuning STHC
- [ ] Telly Pole finetuning:
 * might become owner-only functionality in further releases because teleport function is currently borked
 * I'm open to suggestions to solve the issue about not beeing able to tp avatars through a prim-inventory-LM
- [X] moah coffee!!!
